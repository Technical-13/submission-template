|oneevent
|news = This submission appears to be a news report of a single event and may not be notable enough for an article in Wikipedia. Please see [[Wikipedia:NOT#NEWS]] and [[Wikipedia:ONEEVENT]] for more information.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as a news report on a single event]]</includeonly>
|plot = The proposed article is [[WP:NOT#PLOT|not suitable for Wikipedia]]. Because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, articles on [[WP:FICT|fictional subjects]] should cover their real-world context and contain sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's development, impact or historical significance&mdash;not just a summary of the plot. You may wish to add this content to an existing article{{#if:{{{2|}}}|, such as [[:{{{2}}}]]}}. As anyone can edit Wikipedia, you are free to do so yourself.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as all plot]]</includeonly>

Please improve the submission's referencing, so that the information is [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]], and there is clear evidence of why the subject is [[WP:N|notable]] and worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.<br /><u>What you can do</u>: Add citations <small>(see [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]])</small> to secondary [[WP:IRS|reliable sources]] that are entirely independent of the subject.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as a non-notable film]]</includeonly>

|essay = This submission reads more like an [[WP:NOTESSAY|essay]] than an encyclopedia article. Submissions should summarise information in [[WP:PSTS|secondary, reliable sources]] and not contain opinions or [[WP:OR|original research]]. Please write about the topic from a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] in an [[Wikipedia:Encyclopedic style|encyclopedic manner]].<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as an essay]]</includeonly>

|d
|dict = Wikipedia is an [[encyclopedia]] and [[WP:DICT|not a dictionary]]. We cannot accept articles that are little more than definitions of words or abbreviations as entries. A good article should ''begin'' with a good definition, but expand on the subject. Please try creating an article at [[wikt:Main Page|Wiktionary]] instead.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as a dictionary definition]]</includeonly>
|dup
|duplicate = This appears to be a duplicate of another submission, {{#ifeq: {{{2|}}}|||[[WT:Articles for creation/{{{2}}}|{{{2}}}]]}}, which is also waiting to be reviewed. To save time we will consider the other submission and not this one. <includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as a duplicate]]</includeonly>
|context = This submission provides insufficient [[Wikt:context|context]] for those unfamiliar with the subject matter. Please see the [[Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles|guide to writing better articles]] for information on how to better format your submission. <includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as lacking context]]</includeonly>

Unless stated otherwise, assume that most content on the internet is copyrighted and not suitable for publishing on Wikipedia. Copyrighted content can be [[WP:CITE|cited]] as a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]] if it meets Wikipedia's guidelines; however, your submission must be written in your own words, and in continuous prose.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as copyright violations]]</includeonly>
|empty
|blank = We're sorry, but we cannot accept blank submissions. Please consider submitting to [[Wikipedia:Requested articles]] instead. If in fact you did include text within the article, but it isn't showing, please make sure that any extra text above your entry is removed, as it may be causing it to hide and not be shown to the reviewer.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as blank]]</includeonly>
|adv
|spam
|advert = This submission appears to [[WP:ARTSPAM|read more like an advertisement]] than an entry in an encyclopedia. Encyclopedia articles need to be written from a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], and should refer to a range of [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|independent, reliable, published sources]], not just to materials produced by the creator of the subject being discussed. This is important so that the article can meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability policy]] and the [[Wikipedia:Notability|notability]] of the subject can be established. If you still feel that this subject is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, please rewrite your submission to comply with these policies.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as an advertisement]]</includeonly>

|academic = This submission's references do not adequately evidence the subject's notability&mdash;see the [[Wikipedia:Notability (academics)|guidelines for academics]] and [[WP:VRS|the golden rule]].

|neo = [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms|Neologisms]] are not considered suitable for Wikipedia unless they receive substantial use and press coverage; this requires strong evidence in [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|independent, reliable, published sources]]. Links to sites specifically intended to promote the neologism itself do not establish its notability.<includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as a neologism]]</includeonly>

|lang = {{#if: {{{2|}}}|The submission appears to be written in {{{2}}}.|}} This is the English Language Wikipedia; we can only accept articles written in the [[English Language]].

|joke
|hoax = It appears that your submission is either an attempt to be humorous over being [[WP:V|factual]], or is an obvious hoax. As Wikipedia strives to contain only [[WP:V|factual entries]], we can not accept your submission at this time. <includeonly>[[Category:AfC submissions declined as jokes]]</includeonly>
|npov = This submission does not appear to be written in [[Wikipedia:Encyclopedic style|the formal tone expected of an encyclopedia article]]. Entries should be written from a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], and should refer to a range of [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|independent, reliable, published sources]]. Please rewrite your submission in a more encyclopedic format.

|mergeto = The proposed article does not have sufficient content to require an article of its own, but it could be merged into the existing article {{#if:{{{2|}}}|at [[:{{{2}}}]]|on the same subject}}.
